#DaHood crash bypasser
-
- What is this "dahood crash bypasser"

It's a script that prevents the alts on DaHood from gaining cash via paycheck of money collection.

- How do I use it?

```
getgenv().AvoidCrashExecute = "" -- ur host or acc that picks up cash. (fr don't skip this and actually add your host)

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LPrandom/lua-projects/master/crashAssistant"))()
```

You first cannot be brain dead, if you are, goodluck.

Step 1: Have a decent exectuor, recommend [Synapse X](https://synapsex.co/)

Step 2: Add your host or account that picks up cash, no need if it's a buyer. Add its username inside the "" besides the AvoidCrashExecute

Step 3: Add it to your auto-exec, the script will notify you that it has been executed, and it is working properly.

- How do I know that this is accurate?

Tested it 5 times, 5/5 works, as I said don't be brain dead.
